## Step 1 - Electrical wiring
Requirements:
- AWG 14 wires
- MR60 Connector
- cable Lugs
- pliers
- wirestripper
- soldering iron
- crimping tool

> [!NOTE]
> This is the Part for the PSU-wiring to MOBO. You need to cut the wires and the sleeve in lenght, solder it with the connector and crimp the cable lugs.
> You may find this :tv:[video](https://youtu.be/w0pMjZ-rFQA?si=jAx5m2BBQhHhFl7G):tv: helpful for soldering and this :tv:[additional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrwDEiFtXIc):tv: for applying the sleeve.

Procedure:
1. Use the pliers to cut the the materials in the length provided by this table:

| Quantity | Color  | Lenght | Needed for | 
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 2x | Red wire | 510 +/-10mm | connector to mobo |
| 1x | Black wire | 510 +/-10mm | connector to mobo |
| 2x | Red wire | 150 +/-5mm | PSU to connector |
| 1x | Black wire | 150 +/-5mm | PSU to connector |
| 1x | Protective sleeve | 470 +/-10mm | connector to mobo |
| 1x | Protective sleeve | 100 +/-10mm | PSU to connector |

> [!NOTE]
> The longer cables will be called CTM (connector to mobo), the short cables PSUC (PSU to connector) mind the üñºÔ∏è[electrical wiring diagram](#electrical-wiring-diagram)üñºÔ∏è to get an image of what you're about to archive.

2. Solder PSUC

Strip one end and solder all three 150mm wires it into the male connector. Use the helping hand to hold it in place. Round is for ground. A proper electrical connection is crucial as this connector is very likley to heat up and melt when there is a bad solderjoint. Apply the click-on insulation after inspecting the solder joint.

3. Solder CTM

Repeat the process with the three 510mm wires. Use the female connector.

4. Apply sleeve

Apply the sleeve to both wires and add a heatshrink to secure the sleeve and wires in place.

5. Crimping PSUC

Strip 6mm on the one end left and crimp the SV2-5(Bigger Fork) on all three cables. 

6. Crimping CTM

Repeat the process on the 510mm wires mentioned at 5. Use the SV2-4(smaller Fork)this time.

The result should look like this:

## Step 2 - Disassembly

Requirements:
- Pliers
- screwdriver with hexhead

> [!NOTE]
> In this step all electronical parts are gonna disassembled from the printers frame as preparation for following modifications. The motherboard enclosure, stepper cables, ribbon-cable and the motherboard from the enclosure.
> You will may find this :tv:[video](https://www.youtube.com/live/SQ4Nzgl77F8?si=rxNRZa5gnDLFytx2&t=866):tv: till timestamp 22:05 useful. Mind the üñºÔ∏è[Sovol SV06 Pinout](#sovol-sv06-pinout)üñºÔ∏è.

Procedure:
1. Turn off the machine and unplug power!
2. open the enclosure.
3. unscrew the power supply terminals.
4. unscrew the hot bed terminals. 
5. unplug the hot bed thermistor.
6. unplug all stepper motor cables.
7. unplug 'touch screen'
8. cut and remove the zipties in the two bottom outlets that hold the cables **be careful not to cut a wire accidently.**
9. gently remove all wires from the bottom outlets.
    1. Stepper motor cables
    2. Hot bed
10. unplug the ribbon-cable from the extruder-pcb
    1. unplug Nozzle thermistor.
    2. unscrew the nozzle 24V terminals.
    3. unscrew the normal fan 24V terminals.
    4. unplug the controllable fan.
11. close the enclosure and hold it closed. Then unlock mobo-enclosure and remove the enclosure with the ribbon cable from the printers frame.
12. place the motherboard enclosure on a flat surface and open it again to proceed. 
13. cut the ziptie that hold the extruder-ribbon-cable, **Carefully again not to cut a wire accidently.**
14. disassemble the ribbon-cable from the mobo and the enclosure.
15. unscrew the four motherboard screws. Store the motherboard somewhere. If your conversion is successful you wount need it anymore. Keep the screws!
15. back to the printer the Y-motor-cable and dual-Z-motor-cable are taped together. Gently peel of the tape so they're seperated after.
16. remove the Dual-Z-stepper-cable and store it somewhere. If the conversion is sucessful you wount need it anymore.

## Step 3 - Modifing Extruder Ribbon-Cable

Requirements:
- Wirestripper
- Soldering iron
- flux
- helping hand
- multimeter
- pliers
- tape for marking

> [!NOTE]
> Modification of the toolhead ribbon cable is neccessary so it fits all the connectors on the Fly-E3-V3-Pro. üñºÔ∏è[Schematic 1](#schematic-1)üñºÔ∏è down below shows the original toolhead ribbon cable. üñºÔ∏è[Schematic 2](#schematic-2)üñºÔ∏è shows the final product after modification.

> [!TIP]
> If you having the spare toolhead laying around go and get it. It will be very helpful for this step. A spare toolhead pcb comes really handy as you can easily check if your wiring is as intended.

(click for lager picture)

Procedure:
1. mark the cables for the probe with a tape so its easier to convert it. Mind the üñºÔ∏è[probe cable pinout](#probe-cable-pinout)üñºÔ∏è.
2. cut the probe connector behind your marks cables and strip ~3mm.
3. cut the fan-ferrules from fan+ and fan- and strip ~3mm.
4. crimp or solder on the Dupont connector on the stripped probe-cables. Mind the üñºÔ∏è[probe cable pinout](#probe-cable-pinout)üñºÔ∏è.
5. crimp or solder on JST-Connector on the stripped fan-cables.
6. check the polarity of the FAN. Mind the üñºÔ∏è[board pinout](#board-pinout)üñºÔ∏è.
7. check the polarity of the K-FAN. Mind the üñºÔ∏è[board pinout](#board-pinout)üñºÔ∏è.
8. check the pinout of the new probe-dupont-connector if it matches the Fly-E3-V3-pro. Mind the üñºÔ∏è[board pinout](#board-pinout)üñºÔ∏è.
9. switch port 1 and 3 of the DET-Connector using the pliers.
10. (Optional) remove the tape marks from the probe-connector.

> [!TIP]
> Its possible to leave out the soldering or crimping job with the probe connetor by getting one of [these](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CLD7S5VC/?coliid=I2OEUBWMZKO5ZB&colid=3AEFYUODSS1J9&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it) and make an adapter. Its not really necessary and more costly, but maybe this is a more convinient option for you.

## Step 4 - Modifing Mobo enclosure
Requirements:
- pliers
- small file - For myself I did it with a nail file
- paper towels

> [!NOTE]
> The moobo-enclosure needs minor modification so it fits the Fly-E3-V3-Pro. Mind the üñºÔ∏è[enclosure sanding visualization](#enclosure-sanding-visualization)üñºÔ∏è.

Procedure:
1. Cut the ribs with the pliers marked red in the picture. We need to do that to make room for the Wifi-Antenna at the backside of the board.
2. Sand the holes with the file ~1 up 2mm wider so the USB-connector and SD-Card-slot fit of the Fly-Mobo fit.
3. Test if the Fly mobo fits into the enclosure. If not check for for connectors especially the SD-slot as it stand out alot. A few tries may required to get it right.
4. When the board fits nice and snuggely into the enclosure remove it again clean the enclosure with water and dry it with paper towels.

## Step 5 - Stepper wiring
Requirements:
- pliers

> [!NOTE]
> The two new stepper motor cables need modification for correct wiring.

Procedure:
1. check the 4-pin-connector for orientation for both Z motor cables on the Fly-E3-Pro-V3. Mind the [Z-Motor cable chart](#z-motor-cable-chart).
2. use the pliers to remoove the pins on the motherboard connector. You can pinch on the pins with moderate force, they wount break. Bend the little nose up again befor inserting them back in their connector-housing. Mind the left sequence shown in the table below.
3. check the 6-pin connector for orientation of both cables on Z-steppers.
4. use the pliers to get the right orientation on stepper connector. Bend the little plastic-holders gently upwarts and remove the pins. **Dont try to push the pins, you will break them!**. Bend the nose back again before inserting them in their connector-housing. Mind the right sequence shown in the table below.

   2. place the heatsinks on all drivers.
   3. get the Fly-E3-V3-Pro and screw it into the motherboard enclosure using the four screws we saved from the disassembly.
2. electrical wiring üñºÔ∏è[mind the electronic wiring diagram](#electronic-wiring-diagram)üñºÔ∏è
   1. get the cable we prepared earlier at [Step1](#Step-1---Electrical-wiring) and screw down the the lug connectors in the board. Terminal 3 is for ground. The other two are for voltage.
   2. Route the Power power cable we just screw in down in the opening. Dont ziptie yet!
3. Install ribbon cable üñºÔ∏è[mind the electronic wiring diagram](#electronic-wiring-diagram)üñºÔ∏è
   1. get the modified ribbon cable and place it in the upper opening of the enclosure. Secure it with a ziptie.
   2. plug in all the cables from the extruder ribbon cable.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Mind the orientation of the modified sensor-dupont-connector! Mind the wiring diagram down below to get everything right. Close it after with the screw.

4. assemble enclosure
   1. place the enclosure at the printers-frame and lock it in place.
   2. screw in the bed power cables and the thermistor.
   3. Route the power cable in place. Its much more stiff now so its now bigger bend radius as we crossing your bed-cable. Dont worry it isnt an issue. Secure the two cables with a ziptie.

##  Step 7 - Optional Neopixel
Requirements:
- printed LED-holder (STL is in Folder 'misc/STL')
- helping Hand
- flux
- Solder iron
- 4*1 Bit Neopixel
- Superglue
- 1x JST XH 2,54 3pins with (pre)crimped connectors and 115 +/- 5mm AWG28 wire
- wirestripper
- pliers
- Two M3*6 screws (its possible to use the ones that holded the original partcooler)

> [!NOTE]
> We are going to solder the wires in the Mini-Neopixel, glue it on the holder and then install it.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> to fullfil this step soldering skills beyond beginners level are required. It's assumed you had practiced at least a few times soldering and did simple solderjobs on PCB's.


 Print Settings:
 - 0.4 Nozzle
 - 0.1mm layerheight
- Solid infill
- Heat resistant material like PETG or ABS
- Place on Buildplate as in the STL

1. Preperation
   1. strip around 2mm of the three AWG 28 wires connected to the JST-header. 
   2. place the Neopixel in the helping hand, clamp it down.
2. Soldering
   1. apply flux on the three pads on the backside and apply tin on the pads with the soldering iron. Go short and hot around 400¬∞C. Very little is enough.
   2. place the prepared cables with the connector over the three soldered pads. Take your time to bring them in position. Clamp them with the helping hand very close over the pads. Its a little fiddly but you make it!
   4. When the cables are in position apply some flux again over the cables and solder them on the pretinned pads. I recommend starting with DIN and work your way to GND. ***Go in very short and hot or may the insulation will start to melt.** üü°=In üî¥=5V ‚ö´=GND
   6. check for shorts. If everything seems fine lay it nearby and proceed.
3. Installation on holder
   1. route the cables in the grove with the pliers and gently press the PCB down till everything fits. Its a fiddly job again. If there is alot resistance when pressing the PCB down lift it again and route the cables with the pliers. When everything is right the PCB should go in with a slight click.
   3. Inspect if the pcb sits firmly in the LED-Bracket. When everything seems good, lift it again and apply a drop of superglue on the left and right side of the Neopixel-PCB. Press it on with moderate force for 30 seconds and let it set for ~2 hours.
   4. While the glue is setting you can route the cables through the routing-groove using the pliers.
   5. when the glue is settled screw the holder into the two provided holes for the former partcooler and connect the neopixel to the printhead PCB. Mind the correct wiring, switch if necessary using the pliers to lift the small platic noses. I the cable is a little too long you can route it behind the PCB and then plug the connector in. Mind the üñºÔ∏è[Hotend PCB pinout @ P7](#Hotend-PCB-pinout) so your JST-connector should go  üî¥=V ‚ö´=G üü°=S
   6. secure the cable with a small ziptie on the probes cable so it cant touch the heater block.
4. Testing
   1. See 8 at [setup Klipper](#Configure-Your-printer-and-initial-setup).

The result should look like:

# Klipper Installation
## Before You Begin

- This entire page is a **9 minute read**. Save yourself _hours of troubleshooting_ and read this documentation fully.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your printer is in good physical condition, because print and travel speeds will be _a lot faster_. Beginners would be wise to run through [these steps](https://github.com/bassamanator/everything-sovol-sv06/blob/main/initialsteps.md).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [Disable](https://github.com/bassamanator/everything-sovol-sv06/blob/main/howto.md#disable-usb-cable-5v-pin) the USB cable's 5V pin.
- Follow the steps in order. If an error was reported at a step, do no proceed to the next step.
- It is assumed that you are connected to your host Raspberry Pi (or other host device) via SSH, and that your printer motherboard is connected to the host via a data USB cable. üí° Most of the micro USB cables that you find at home are _unlikely_ to be data cables, and it is not possible to tell just by looking.
- It is also assumed that the username on the host device is `pi`. If that is not the case, edit `moonraker.conf` and `cfgs/misc-macros.cfg` to change any mentions of `/home/pi` to `/home/yourUserName`.
- Klipper _must_ be installed on the host beforehand. Easiest is to use [MainsailOS](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail/releases/latest). [KIAUH](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh) is another option.
- Klipper _must_ be up to date.
  - In `Fluidd`, you can do this from `Settings` > `Software Updates`.
  - In `Mainsail`, you can do this from `Machine` > `Update Manager`.
- Robert Redford's performance in _Spy Game (2001)_ was superb!
- It is assumed that there is one instance of Klipper installed. If that is not the case, the steps in this guide will not work _perfectly_ for you.
- Your question has probably been answered already, but if it hasn't, please post in the [Discussion](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/discussions) section.
- I would recommend searching for the word `NOTE` in this configuration. There are roughly half a dozen short points amongst the various files that you should be aware of.
<!-- - Link to recommended parts. -->

### Important Note About Stepper Motor Current

For the Fly-E3-Pro-V3.0, the run_current for x, y, z stepper motors has been reduced in the printer.cfg, because the standard current seems to make the steppers dangerously hot. You may have to increase the current, or if the motors are still too hot, you may have to decrease it.

üí° Although stepper motors can withstand upwards of 125C, they should at the most get hot to the touch (~55C), not very hot.

## Optinal Compile Firmware
Its recommended using the `firmware.bin`from the `misc/` folder. But ist possible to compile the firmware by yourself. Use the following settings:

<img src="./misc/images/Klippermakemenuconfig.png" height="250">

## Flash Firmware
üí° If you flashed Klipper onto your motherboard in the past, you can skip this step.

Please note:

- For the sake of simplicity, I will refer to the klipper firmware file as `firmware.bin` even though the actual filename is something along the lines of `firmware-v0.12.0-10-gea2f6bc0-UNTESTED.bin`.
- The firmware file **must** be named `firmware.bin`.
- The firmware file is located in `misc/`.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Many users have reported having issues flashing Klipper using the Sovol microSD card.

#### 1. Prepare the microSD Card for Flashing with These Parameters

- Size: `16GB` maximum.
- File system: `FAT32`.
- Allocation unit size: `4096 bytes`.
- Must not contain any files _except_ the firmware file.

#### 2. Flashing Procedure
##### Method 1 - Basic
1. Disconnect any USB cables that might be connected to the motherboard.
2. Copy `firmware.bin` to the microSD card. The firmware is located in the directory `misc`.
3. Make sure the printer is off.
4. Insert the microSD card into printer.
5. Turn on the printer and wait a minute (usually takes 10 seconds).
6. Turn off the printer and remove the microSD.

##### Method 2 - Advanced
I recommend using [Katapult](https://github.com/Arksine/katapult). As it's a topic on its very own, it wount explained on this repo how to use it. It's **not necessary** but a quality of live upgrade as you dont have to use SD-Cards anymore, once you set it up. It comes really handy when Klipper-Updates need an update of the firmeware. You can easily flash firmeware via the SSH-Console not even touching the MOBO or printer.

>[!TIP]
> Mind the follow changes in firmeware compilation:
> Bootloader offset (32KiB bootloader)  --->
> USB ids  --->

‚è≤Ô∏è At this point, it's not possible to tell with certainty whether your flash was successful. You can check at your desktop-PC if the file was renamed to `firmware.cur` on the SD-card which is an indicator for a successfull flash. Anyways continue on with the guide.

## Download OSS Klipper Configuration
### Method 1: Clone the Repository

üí° Make sure git is installed (sudo apt update && sudo apt install git).

1. `cd ~/printer_data/config`
2. Empty entire ~/printer_data/config folder.
- In linux, you can delete files via rm fileName and directories via rmdir directoryName.
- In linux, you can list files and folders via ls -lah.
3. `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/ElPainis/Fly-E3-Pro-v3.git .` ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't miss the period!

### Method 2: Download the ZIP

1. [Download](https://github.com/ElPainis/Fly-E3-Pro-v3/archive/refs/heads/fly-e3-pro-v3.zip) the `ZIP` file containing the Klipper configuration.
2. See `Step 2` in `Method 1`.
3. The parent folder in the `ZIP` is Sovol-SV06-firmware-master. This is relevant in the next step.
4. Extract only the contents of the parent folder into `~/printer_data/config.`

## Initial Steps

## Adjust Configuration with MCU Path

üí° Make sure the host and printer are connected via USB.

1. Find what port the `mcu` (printer motherboard) is connected to via _one_ of the following commands:

   - `ls /dev/serial/by-id/*`
   - `ls /dev/serial/by-path/*`

   1. The output will be something along the lines of
      - `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0`

2. Adjust the `[mcu]` section in `printer.cfg` accordingly.

   ```yaml
   # üìù This is just an example
   [mcu]
   serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0
   restart_method: command
   ```

3. Do a `FIRMWARE_RESTART`.

If the Klipper flash that you did earlier was successful, and you've done everything else correctly, you should see no errors or warnings in the `Mainsail`/`Fluidd` dashboard. üéâ **Your printer has been Klipperized!** üéâ

[üîº Back to top](#outline)

## Configure Your Printer and initial setup

‚ùó‚ò†Ô∏è **Your finger should be on the power switch for most of these steps** ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ùó

‚ùó‚ò†Ô∏è **Power off if there is a collision/problem** ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ùó

üí° The ${\small{\textcolor{red}{\texttt{EMERGENCY STOP}}}}$ button in your dashboard works faster than hitting the power switch.

üí° Do a practice emergency stop.

üí° I recommend no filament be loaded for any of these steps.

üí° Check if you get correct temperature reading from the bed and hotend. It should correspond with your roomtemperature.

üí° Check if your hotend and bed heats up when you enter a number at the temperatures setting.

üí° Check if the hotend fan and partcooler fan are working. First one should start as you start heating the hotend, the second one you can activate via `Mainsail`/`Fluidd`.

üìù You will be pasting/typing these commands into the `Mainsail`/`Fluidd` console.

1. Check to see if `X` and `Y` max positions can be reached, and adjust `position_max`, if necessary. You might be able to go further, which is great, but I recommend leaving a 2mm gap for safety.
   1. `G28`
   2. `G90`
   3. `G1 X223 F3000`
   4. `G1 Y223 F3000`
2. Do a mechanical gantry calibration; `G34`. After the controlled collision against the beam at the top, there will be a 10 second pause for you to verify that both sides of the gantry are pressed up against the `stoppers` at the top. You will hear a succession of beeps.
   1. Figure out your `Z` `position_max` by baby stepping your way up to the beam, and adjust `position_max`, if necessary.
   2. OPTIONAL: Now you can use Z-Tilt
3. PID tune the bed. Ideally, all PID tuning should occur at the temperatures that you print most at.
   1. `PID_TEST_BED TEMP=70`
   2. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)
4. PID tune the extruder while part cooling fan runs at 25%.
   1. `PID_TEST_HOTEND TEMP=245`
   2. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)
5. Calibrate X-Twist-Compensation. Make sure your nozzle if very clean. Follow the wizard and do the [Paper test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html?h=probe_calibrate#the-paper-test).
   1. `AXIS_TWIST_COMPENSATION_CALIBRATE ` 
   2. Follow `AXIS_TWIST_COMPENSATION_CALIBRATE` setup in `Mainsail`/`Fluidd`.
6. Adjust `z_offset`. Make sure your nozzle if very clean. Do the [Paper test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html?h=probe_calibrate#the-paper-test).
   1. `DO_PROBE_CALIBRATE`
   2. Follow `z_offset` setup in `Mainsail`/`Fluidd`.
   3. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)
7. Create a bed mesh.
   1. `DO_CREATE_MESH`
   2. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)
8. Test Neopixel
   1. If your Neopixel is turning on after Klipper booted its a good sign
   2. type in in your console `LED_Printing`. Your Neopixel should turn to bright white.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> For future calibration after initial setup of your printer use:
> 1. `mechanical gantry calibration`
> 2. `screw tilt calculate` (if you have the required modifications)
> 3. `Z-Tilt` to archieve the best first layer possible.

>[!NOTE]
> You will need `mechanical calibration` to enshure your X-gantry squarness. After setting up your `AXIS_TWIST_COMPENSATION_CALIBRATE ` you can enshure getting the right readings for further calibration like `screw tilt calculate`. Only then you will fully benefit from `Z-Tilt`. After calibrating your machine like this you will need `Z-Tilt` from time to time. When you observe degenerations in bedmesh, like a tilted mesh and/or increasing in deviation its time for a `Z-Tilt`. If there is no improvment in the bed mesh at all try a `mechanical gantry calibration` first and a `Z-Tilt` after.

üèÅ If you've made it here, then your Klipperized and modded printer is ready to print! üèÅ

_But first_, adjust your slicer.

[üîº Back to top](#outline)

## Adjust Your Slicer

üìù If you are using the slicer bundles found on this repo, you can skip this section.

### Start G-Code

It varies depending on your slicer. Find instructions [here](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/passing_slicer_variables.html#slicer-start-g-code).

## End G-Code

```
PRINT_END
```

## Line Purge

If you would like to print a purge line before your print starts, at the end of your start gcode, on a new line, add one of the following:

- `PURGE_LINE`; prints a standard purge line.
- `LINE_PURGE`; prints KAMP's purge line. ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not attempt to use without reading [this section](#how-do-i-enable-kamp-klipper-adaptive-meshing--purging).

```yaml
# üìù This is just an example Start G-Code
PRINT_START ...
PURGE_LINE
